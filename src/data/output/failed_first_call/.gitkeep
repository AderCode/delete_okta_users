/**
 * The `.gitkeep` file is used to keep an empty directory tracked by Git.
 * Git does not track empty directories by default, so the `.gitkeep` file is added
 * to indicate that the directory should be kept even if it is empty.
 * 
 * This convention is commonly used to preserve the directory structure and ensure
 * that the empty directory is included when cloning or checking out the repository.
 * 
 * It's important to note that the `.gitkeep` file itself does not have any special
 * meaning to Git. It is simply a convention used by developers to indicate the
 * intention of keeping an empty directory in the repository.
